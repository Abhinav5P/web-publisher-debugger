# Privacy Policy for Web Publisher Debugger

**Last updated: January 2025**

## Overview

Web Publisher Debugger is a Chrome extension designed to help web publishers debug and analyze their pages. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.

## Data Collection

### What We Collect

This extension collects the following data **locally in your browser** for debugging purposes:

- **Website Content**: Meta tags, Open Graph data, structured data (JSON-LD), and other SEO-related information
- **Ad Tech Data**: Prebid.js configurations, Google Publisher Tag (GPT) slot information, and auction data
- **Tracking Data**: Google Tag Manager dataLayer events, GA4 configuration, and tracking pixel information

### What We Do NOT Collect

- Personal information (name, email, address)
- Browsing history
- Passwords or authentication data
- Financial information
- Location data

## Data Storage

### Local Storage Only

All collected data is processed and stored **locally in your browser** using Chrome's built-in storage APIs. We do not operate any servers that collect or store your data.

### API Keys

If you use the AI Assistant feature, your API keys (Anthropic Claude or OpenAI) are stored locally in Chrome's encrypted sync storage. API keys are:

- Never transmitted to our servers
- Only used for direct communication with your chosen AI provider
- Stored using Chrome's built-in encryption

## Third-Party Services

### AI Providers (Optional)

When using the AI Assistant feature, page data may be sent to:

- **Anthropic** (if using Claude): Subject to [Anthropic's Privacy Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/privacy)
- **OpenAI** (if using GPT): Subject to [OpenAI's Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/privacy/)

This data transmission only occurs when you actively use the AI feature and is sent directly from your browser to the AI provider using your own API key.

## Data Sharing

We do not:

- Sell your data to third parties
- Share your data with advertisers
- Use your data for any purpose other than providing the debugging functionality
- Transmit any data to our own servers

## Your Rights

You can:

- Disable any feature (SEO, AdTech, GTM, Analytics) in the extension settings
- Remove your API keys at any time
- Uninstall the extension to remove all locally stored data

## Children's Privacy

This extension is designed for web developers and publishers. It is not intended for use by children under 13 years of age.
